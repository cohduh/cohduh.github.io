    <hl><b>Escape Rooms</b></hl>            <!-- b is for bold but not important -->
    <p>Outside of academia, my interests include puzzles. I've always enjoyed puzzles of various types; however, escape rooms would have to be my favorite. A timed, physically interactive, and collaborative challenge - <em>there's nothing better</em>.</p>
    <p>The best escape room I've completed is the <a href="https://www.enchambered.com/booking/skull-witch/" title="Book An Escape" target="_blank">Skull Witch</a> room at <strong>Enchambered: Sacramento Escape Room</strong></p>
